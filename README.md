# Springboard Projects

This repository consists of all code, data and files related to my work in Springboard's Data Science Immersive Program. The contemts along with descriptions and appropriate links are provided below:

## Capstone Project 1

### Machine Powered Investing in Lending Club
**Description:**
Machine Learning algorithms were used to create a loan classification model for conservative investors using data from the Lending Club website. Prior to developing the model, the data obtained was cleaned and explored. The work was completed in three notebooks:
* [Data Wrangling Notebook](https://github.com/paulb17/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%201/Data_Wrangling%20.ipynb)
* [Data Exploration Notebook](https://github.com/paulb17/Springboard/blob/master/Capstone%20Project%201/Data_Exploration.ipynb)
* [Machine Learning Notebook]()

**Key Skills:**
* Data Wrangling
* Data Visualization
* Inferential Statistics
* Machine Learning


## Exploratory Data Analysis' (EDA)

### [Hospital Readmittance Data](https://github.com/paulb17/Springboard/blob/master/EDA%20Mini%20Projects/EDA%20hospital%20readmit/Hospital%20Readmissions.ipynb)
Hospital Readmittance performs a statistical analysis on a previously done analysis to critique its validity.

### [Human Temperature Data](https://github.com/paulb17/Springboard/blob/master/EDA%20Mini%20Projects/EDA%20human%20temperature/EDA%20Human%20Body%20Temperature.ipynb)
Human Temperature EDA uses bootstrap statistics to determine the true average temperature of the human body in both male and females.

### [Racial Discrimination Data](https://github.com/paulb17/Springboard/blob/master/EDA%20Mini%20Projects/EDA%20racial%20discrimination/EDA%20Job%20Market%20Discrimination.ipynb)
Racial Discrimination performs a statistical analysis on if race has a meaningful impact on the callback rate of candidates who have submitted resumes to jobs of interest.
